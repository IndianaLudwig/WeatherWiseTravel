        travel planning by providing recommendations based on where a person is
        leaving from, going to, the dates they are at the destination, the
        activities they want to enjoy, and the weather forcasted for while they
        are at the destination. WeatherWise Travel presents an all-in-one travel
        information hub providing information on flights, car rentals, hotels,
        the weather, and various activity locations at the travel destination 
        along with a map. More information about the locations can be obtained

            <li></li>
        </ul>
        Note that WeatherWise Travel will only recommend outdoor activities if
        the forcasted weather on the selected day is amicable to the outdoor
        activity chosen, otherwise presenting indoor activities as recommended.
